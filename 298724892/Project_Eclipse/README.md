## Letter_A.pdf
The letter say:
```
You've come far, perhaps farther than even I anticipated, and far closer to the truth than
they ever intended. Umbra's shadow looms over everything now, and time is slipping
away. You must understand: this is far bigger than me or the Keystone. They call it
Project Eclipse. A name as veiled as their intentions. It is not just a project. It is their
endgame.
I have scattered what I know, burying secrets in places even they cannot read. This letter
is the first thread in a long and tangled web. The next one is where we left the lantern
burning. She'll understand. No one else will.
It's time Iris knew the full truth. She's waited long enough, and knowing her, she's
probably already pieced together most of this puzzle herself. But this will give her what she
needs for the next step.
Take this to her. If anyone can finish what I started, it's her.
In shadows and light,
Arthur Lang

It's written in a weird way, and even if the image definition is pretty poor, the pdf size is 38 MB.  
I think it needs to be investigated if there are hidden files in PDF container.
